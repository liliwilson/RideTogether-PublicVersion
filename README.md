# RideTogether-PublicVersion

This is the public version of a game I made for my friend in March 2021! Some bits of the game are cut out to preserve privacy and personal aspects of the project, but much of the logic and puzzle content remains.

Many of the puzzles will be unsolvable to people other than the friend that the game was designed for, due to the use of personal information in their solutions.

From a programming perspective, my favorite levels would be Level 1 and Level 6, although I'm personally proud of every level : ) 

Graphics credit goes to my younger sister Maia, who designed and drew all of the characters used in the app.
