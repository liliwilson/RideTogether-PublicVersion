# Ride Together - Public Version

This is the public version of **Ride Together**, a game I made for my friend in March 2021! Some bits of the game are cut out to preserve privacy and personal aspects of the project, but much of the logic and puzzle content remains. I wrote the app entirely using Swift, as it was designed to run on an iPhone. This was my first time using Swift and looking back I now notice many areas that could have been programmed more elegantly. 

From a programming perspective, Levels 1 and 6 are the most interesting and were the most fun to work on (although I'm proud of every level). 

Many of the puzzles will be unsolvable to people other than the friend that the game was designed for, due to the use of personal information in their solutions.

# Credits
All puzzles were designed entirely by me, and I worked on this game alone from December 2020 to March 2021. 

Graphics credit goes to my younger sister Maia, who designed and drew all of the characters used in the app.
